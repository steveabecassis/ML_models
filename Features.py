Statistical tests can be used to select those features that have the strongest relationship with the output variable.
The scikit-learn library provides the SelectKBest class that can be used with a suite of different statistical tests to select a specific number of features.
The example below uses the chi-squared (chiÂ²) statistical test for non-negative features to select 10 of the best features from the Mobile Price Range Prediction Dataset.
'''
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2
data = pd.read_csv("D://Blogs//train.csv")
X = data.iloc[:,0:20]  #independent columns
y = data.iloc[:,-1]    #target column i.e price range
#apply SelectKBest class to extract top 10 best features
bestfeatures = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=10)
fit = bestfeatures.fit(X,y)
dfscores = pd.DataFrame(fit.scores_)
dfcolumns = pd.DataFrame(X.columns)
#concat two dataframes for better visualization 
featureScores = pd.concat([dfcolumns,dfscores],axis=1)
featureScores.columns = ['Specs','Score']  #naming the dataframe columns
print(featureScores.nlargest(10,'Score'))  #print 10 best features

You can get the feature importance of each feature of your dataset by using the feature importance property of the model.
Feature importance gives you a score for each feature of your data, the higher the score more important or relevant is the feature towards your output variable.
Feature importance is an inbuilt class that comes with Tree Based Classifiers, we will be using Extra Tree Classifier for extracting the top 10 features for the dataset.

'''
Correlation states how the features are related to each other or the target variable.
Correlation can be positive (increase in one value of feature increases the value of the target variable) or negative (increase in one value of feature decreases the value of the target variable)
Heatmap makes it easy to identify which features are most related to the target variable, we will plot heatmap of correlated features using the seaborn library.

#get correlations of each features in dataset
corrmat = data.corr()

#plot heat map

Permutation Importance:
In Permutation Importance we ask Instead we will ask the following question:
If I randomly shuffle a single column of the validation data, leaving the target and all other columns in place,
how would that affect the accuracy of predictions in that now-shuffled data?
